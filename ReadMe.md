Hi Prof. Assiter,

Here is my submission for [Project 3: Queues](https://landmark.instructure.com/courses/3993/assignments/97875).  I completed it in Python, but implemented the Queue without using any of Python's built-in features, except for such features as are *also* available in Java.  

Data Structure:
* [CircArrayQueue.py](CircArrayQueue.py)

Supplemental Classes:
* [Airline.py](Airline.py)
* [Airplane.py](Airplane.py)

Main Simulation:
* [Airport.py](Airport.py)

I will demonstrate the project in class.

Here is my [writeup](Writeup.md) of the project.

Thanks,

Wolf Elkan
